This is Gideon - virtual assistant

Instruction for execution:
    1. activate the virtual environment
        > source env/bin/activate
    2. run ui.py file
        > python3 ui.py

Bugs:
    1. Speech recognition usnig google speech recognition module is not clear. It cannot recognize your commands directly

    2. Purposefully gets into infinite loop while recognizing commands

Working:
    1. You won't have to know what is going while ui is setting up as gideon will inform you of the process
    2. After setup is completed, face recognition will be done
    3. To make gideon recognize your face, add your photo in users folder
    4. Hit the mike icon at bottom and give a command to gideon
    
Information:
    1. There are many more features in gideon which were implemented but commands to handle them are not implemented yet.
    2. So it will be better if you look at utilities.py file
